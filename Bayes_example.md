$P(Stolen | Red, SUV, Domestic)$

According to Bayes' Theorem:

$P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \times P(A)}{P(B)}$

Where:

- P(A|B) is the probability for (Stolen given Red, SUV, Domestic).
- P(B|A) is the likelihood, which is the probability of observing the evidence given that the car is stolen.
- P(A) is the prior probability of the car being stolen.
- P(B) is the total probability of observing the evidence.


1. **Prior Probability (P(A)):**

   $P(Stolen) = \frac{5}{10} = 0.5$

2. **Likelihood (P(B|A)):**

   - $P(Red | Stolen) = \frac{3}{5}$
   - $P(SUV | Stolen) = \frac{1}{5}$
   - $P(Domestic | Stolen) = \frac{2}{5}$

   multiply these probabilities together:

   $P(Red, SUV, Domestic | Stolen) = \frac{3}{5} \times \frac{1}{5} \times \frac{2}{5} = \frac{6}{125}$

3. **Total Probability (P(B)):**

   - $P(Red) = \frac{5}{10} = 0.5$
   - $P(SUV) = \frac{4}{10} = 0.4$
   - $P(Domestic) = \frac{5}{10} = 0.5$

   Multiply these probabilities together:

   $P(Red, SUV, Domestic) = 0.5 \times 0.4 \times 0.5 = 0.1$

4. **Use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the final probability:**

   $P(Stolen | Red, SUV, Domestic) = \frac{\frac{6}{125} \times 0.5}{0.1} = 0.24$

So, the probability that the car is stolen given that it's red, an SUV, and domestic is 24%.
