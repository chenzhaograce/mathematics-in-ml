- Question: Please explain why the final optimal F0(x) is the average of yi, use the mathematical methods to prove it
- Answer: Let's derive the optimal initial prediction F_0(x) for the Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT) in the context of a regression problem with a squared error loss function.

### Problem Setup:
Given a dataset with N samples, where $x_i$ is the $i^{th}$ input and $y_i$ is the corresponding target value, we want to find an initial prediction $F_0(x)$ that minimizes the squared error loss.

The squared error loss for a single data point is given by:
$L(y_i, F(x_i)) = (y_i - F(x_i))^2$

The objective is to find $F_0(x)$ that minimizes the average squared error loss over all data points:
$J(F_0) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (y_i - F_0(x_i))^2$

### Derivation:
For simplicity, let's denote $F_0(x_i)$ as $F_0$ since it's a constant prediction for all data points.

The objective function becomes:
$J(F_0) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (y_i - F_0)^2$

To find the value of $F_0$ that minimizes $J(F_0)$, we'll differentiate $J(F_0)$ with respect to $F_0$ and set the derivative to zero.

Differentiating $J(F_0)$ with respect to $F_0$:
$\frac{dJ(F_0)}{dF_0} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} -2(y_i - F_0)$

Setting the derivative to zero:
$\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} -2(y_i - F_0) = 0$   
$\sum_{i=1}^{N} y_i - N \cdot F_0 = 0$   
$F_0 = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} y_i$

Thus, the optimal initial prediction $F_0(x)$ that minimizes the average squared error loss is the average of the target values $y_i$.

### Conclusion:
The mathematical derivation shows that the optimal initial prediction for GBDT, when using the squared error loss function, is the average of the target values. This is because the average minimizes the sum of squared differences between the predicted and actual values.
